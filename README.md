**What Is Computer Programming?**
---

- Computer Programming is a set of instructions, that helps the developer to perform certain tasks that return the desired output for the valid inputs.

**Given below is a Mathematical Expression.**

```python Z = X + Y,``` where **X**, **Y**, and **Z** are the variables in a programming language. If **X = 550** and **Y = 450**, the value of X and Y are the input values that are called literals.
We ask the computer to calculate the value of **X+Y**, which results in Z, i.e. the expected output.

### **How Do Computers Work?**
- A computer is a machine that processes information and this information can be any data that is provided by the user through devices such as keyboards, mice, scanners, digital cameras, joysticks, and microphones.
- 
These devices are called **Input Devices** and the information provided is called **input**. 

**The computer requires storage to store this information and the storage is called Memory.**

#### **Computer Storage or Memory is of Two Types.**

- Primary Memory or RAM (Random Access Memory): This is the internal storage that is used in the computers and is located on the motherboard. RAM can be accessed or modified quickly in any order or randomly. The information that is stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.

- Secondary Memory or ROM (Read-Only Memory): Information (data) stored in ROM is read-only, and is stored permanently. The ROM stored instruction is required to start a computer.


- **Processing:** Operations done on this information (input data) is called Processing. The Processing of input is done in the Central Processing Unit which is popularly known as CPU.

- **Output Devices:** These are the computer hardware devices that help in converting information into human-readable form. Some of the output devices include Visual Display Units (VDU) such as a Monitor, Printer, Graphics Output devices, Plotters, Speakers, etc.

A developer can analyze the problem and come up with simple steps to achieve a solution to this problem, for which he/she uses a programming algorithm. This can be compared to a recipe for a food item, where ingredients are inputs and finished delicacy is the output required by the client.

In the development environment, the products, software, and solutions can be designed as scenarios, use cases, and data flow diagrams.

Based on the clientâ€™s requirements, the solution required could be desktop, web or mobile-based.


### **basic Programming Concepts.**
Developers should have essential knowledge on the following concepts to become skilled in Computer Programming,

- **Algorithm:** It is a set of steps or instruction statements to be followed to accomplish specific tasks. A developer can design his algorithm to achieve the desired output. For Example, a recipe to cook a dessert. The algorithm describes the steps to be followed for completing a specific task, but it does not say how to achieve any of the steps.

- **Source code:** Source code is the actual text that is used to construct the program using the language of choice.

```python
# Define a function `plus()`
def plus(a,b):
  return a + b
```  

- **Compiler:** Compiler is a software program that helps in converting the source code into binary code or byte code, also called machine language, that is easy for a computer to understand, and can be further executed using an interpreter to run the program.

- **Data Type:** Data used in the applications can be of a different type, it can be a whole number (integer), floating-point (decimal point numbers), characters or objects. For Example, double currency = 45.86, where double is a data type used for storing numbers with decimal points.

- **Variable:** Variable is a space holder for the value stored in the memory and this value can be used in the application. For Example, int age = 25, where age is a variable.

- **Conditionals:** Knowledge of how to use a certain condition, such that a set of code should execute only if a certain condition is true. In case of a false condition, the program should exit and should not continue the code further.

- **Array:** Array is the variable that stores elements of a similar data type. Knowledge of using an array in coding/programming will be a great benefit.

- **Loop:** Loop is used to execute the series of code until the condition is true. For Example, in Java, loops can be used as for loop, do-while, while loop or enhanced for loop.
