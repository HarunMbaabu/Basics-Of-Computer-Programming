**What Is Computer Programming?**
---

- Computer Programming is a set of instructions, that helps the developer to perform certain tasks that return the desired output for the valid inputs.

**Given below is a Mathematical Expression.**

```python Z = X + Y,``` where **X**, **Y**, and **Z** are the variables in a programming language. If **X = 550** and **Y = 450**, the value of X and Y are the input values that are called literals.
We ask the computer to calculate the value of **X+Y**, which results in Z, i.e. the expected output.
